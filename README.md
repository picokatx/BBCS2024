Can we do social experiments?
maybe I'll think later

Game, I have it memorized
Intervention function: 


An AI social media algorithm that influences social interactions to combat stigmatization

Stigmatized: Can rate stuff like their level of stigma possessed, how much they are being stigmatized for their stigma,
Stigmatizer: Such individuals should be punished for their stigma. low views or whatever. 
Active wise: promote their words plz. 
ethics: I argue that current socia media networks already enable stgimatization as an artifact of  profit being the goal of social media algorithms, hence creating stigmas of anti-profit behaviour, which may not be socially harmful behaviour. An AI system to manually control what stigmas exist and don't exist can prevent societal issues like bullying, scams, cancel culture, and choose to promote prosocial behaviours.
Basic Idea: Grade n topics based on their social stigma, promote anti-stigma behaviour and punish stigma behaviour. Have settings to determine what gets punished and not. Can also attach AI model to grade if content is prosocial or not. 




hhhhh since most prosocial networks require reinforcement learning we'd probably have to install lsososoososooo many libraries JSGgjsjpbfs oh ok calm down you. 

AI assistance allowed, can ask facils for guidance

no it's too risky
